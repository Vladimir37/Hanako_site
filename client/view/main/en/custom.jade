            | If you do not want to use the default design displayed in Hanako, or you wish to add some more features
            | or some more options or your own scripts, you can easily do it. For your own scripts
            | and styles are made a special directory, which you can find at this address
            span.mark Hanako/client/source/mods
            | .
        article.note
            | You can add the files in any folder, but it is not recommended, because it creates more confusion.
        p
            | Once a file has been placed in this directory, you can access it at the address
            span.mark domain/src/mods/file name
            | . Do not forget that you can create your own directories within
            span.mark mods
            | . In order to add your style or script to a page, you must register it in the template. At the following address
            span.mark Hanako/client/views/basis
            | you can find the template files
            span.mark layout.jade
            | Ð¸
            span.mark layout_boards.jade
            | . The first one is responsible for the main page, administrative panel and other pages, and the second one - for the board and each separate
            | thread.
        article.note
            | More information about Jade template system, you can learn from
            a(href="http://jade-lang.com/") the official website
            | .
        p In order to add your newly created script or style to the page, you need to write into the specific programming line.
            | For example, let's take a file with the name
            span.mark style.css
            | , which we added in
            span.mark mods
            | and want to upload along with
            span.mark layout_boards.jade
            | . Now open the file
            span.mark layout_boards.jade
            | .
        img(src="/src/img/docs/11.png" alt="doc11")
        p
            | It must be added into the line
        span.mark link(rel="stylesheet" href="/src/mods/style.css")
        p
            | in the specific section
            span.mark head
            | . We write it to the rest of the styles, between rows 17 and 18 on the image.
        p
            | As we have seen, adding new styles, and scripts are quite simple. But what if we want to
            | add a static page? For example, you need to create a page with the rules or FAQ. Adding it is even easier!
            | At the address
            span.mark Hanako/client/views/other
            | you can find a directory for user pages. It is enough to put your page there in the usual
            | HTML format and then go to the adess
            span.mark domain/your_file
            | , and it will be opened. For example, if we put there a file with specific name
            span.mark rules.html
            | , then you can see it in the corresponding address
            span.mark domain/rules.html
            | . So that the users become aware of the existence of this page, add links to it on other pages.
            | You can read in detail about the various files in the next section.
